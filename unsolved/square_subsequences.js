// Square Subsequences
//
// A string is called a square string if it can be obtained by concatenating two copies of the same string. For example, "abab", "aa" are square strings, while "aaa", "abba" are not. Given a string, how many (non-empty) subsequences of the string are square strings? A subsequence of a string can be obtained by deleting zero or more characters from it, and maintaining the relative order of the remaining characters.
//
// Input Format
//
// The first line contains the number of test cases, .
//  test cases follow. Each case contains a string, .
//
// Output Format
//
// Output  lines, one for each test case, containing the required answer modulo 1000000007.
//
// Constraints:
//
//  will have at most  lowercase characters ('a' - 'z').
//
// Sample Input
//
// 3
// aaa
// abab
// baaba
//
// Sample Output
//
// 3
// 3
// 6
//
// Explanation
//
// For the first case, there are 3 subsequences of length 2, all of which are square strings.
// For the second case, the subsequences "abab", "aa", "bb" are square strings.
// Similarly, for the third case, "bb", "baba" (twice), and "aa" (3 of them) are the square subsequences.
